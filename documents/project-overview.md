## Problem Statement

**Challenge**: Baseball has an extensive and complex history, with decades of stats, stories, and record-breaking events. Fans lack a single platform that both aggregates official data and fosters ongoing discussion with context-driven AI personalities.

**Pain Points**:
- Forums and chat apps have minimal or no integrated baseball data.
- Official MLB apps provide stats but lack robust community engagement or AI-driven insight.
- Searching baseball history is time-consuming and scattered across multiple sites.

4. **AWS Amplify Infrastructure**: Simple, secure, and easily deployable solution that scales automatically.
5. **Secure Access**: Only authenticated users can join channels, ensuring a more serious, spam-free environment.
